    Sol lived. He was all that remained. Under the earth floor of every home, he
    had buried their dwellers, just as it had alway been done.
  </p>

  <p>
    A dark cloud climbed Home Hill a week before and stormed the hamlet. Beasts,
    slaves, persons, young and all fell into a feverish sleep. Only Sol, a boy
    of 14, stood up again. The kid was exhausted of digging for six days, 24 
    graves. Into four he dragged six, into another three he dragged eight, into
    the rest he dragged seven; so 167 souls rested on earth. Dead cattle and 
    slaves, he threw into the fire, and he almost threw himself into it as well.
  <p>

  <p>
    "Mother, tell, what should I do?"
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The boy, covered in sweat, soot and ashes, dropped in tears and slept. It
    was well beyond dawn when he awoke knowing very well what he was to do. 
    He was to walk to the East, to the end of the world, to meet the Dawn and 
    awake the Goddess who sleeps, so Death could turn to Warmth, and Warmth 
    would conquer everything.
