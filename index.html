    Sol lived. He was all that remained. Under the earth floor of every home, he
    had buried their dwellers, just as it had alway been done, so each
    family rested together with their ancestors.
  </p>

  <p>
    A dark cloud had climbed Home Hill a week before and stormed the hamlet. Beasts,
    slaves, persons, young and old, fell into a feverish sleep. Only Sol, a boy
    of 14, stood up again. The kid was exhausted of a week of digging Dead cattle and 
    slaves, he threw into the fire, and he almost threw himself into it as well.
  <p>

  <p>
    "Mother, tell, what should I do?"
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The boy, covered in sweat, soot and ashes, dropped in tears and slept. It
    was well beyond dawn when he awoke knowing very well what he was to do. 
    He was to walk to the East, to the end of the world, to meet the Dawn and 
    awake the Goddess who sleeps, so Death could turn to Warmth, and Warmth 
    would conquer everything.
  </p>

  <p>
    He washed himself in the well, hearing the howls of the Wolves of the Red
    Mountain. Given time, they would come for him. Either them or the slavers;
    a silent village cannot be hidden. For hunters would not sortie from its 
    walls, nor traders would receive a prize for their efforts and soon the 
    valleys would know of the lone boy of Home Hill.
  </p>

  <p>
    He took spear, sling and shield; his father's helmet too. A tunic on his
    body, sandals for his feet, a cloak on his shoulder. Tied to his pack: 
    a bag of <em>gud</em>, a water leather, an oiled tarp for shelter a tinder
    bag, two baskets and little else. He went to the cold pyre were
    beasts and slaves had laid, kissed the ahses and slowly walked Eastwards.
