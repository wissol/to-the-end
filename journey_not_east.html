    Sol loaded his sling, stood up from the cover of the bushes and swung his weapon. 
    Once, twice, thrice, and then let the missile loose. The stone flew whistling through the air, striking one of the slavers right in the
    back of her helmet. 
    The slaver tottered and almost fell but quickly recovered her posture.
    Sol reached for his weapong again, but his second hasted stone hit the shield of his target harmlessly.
    There would be not time for a third try.

  Sol drove his steps away from the setting sun into the plains, sneaked into 
  the bush, away from the creek and set up camp. Night came mercifully slowly so
  at the time of darkness, the mourning was done and the boy fell into a deep 
  sleep.
</p>

<p>
  Sol woke up as Yer, &mdash;the second sun&mdash;, was raising over the distant 
  horizon; Anur already shining through orange clouds. The boy prepared himself
  a breakfast of <em>gud</em>, stroke camp and walked to the creek for water.
  Eyes and ears alert for wolves or worse could be watched, he filled his leather
  bag and ran to the East.
</p>

<p>
  It was the hour of the first midday, when Anur reaches the limits of the 
  heavens, when Sol heard sounds of strife over a wooded knoll. Intrigued, he
  ran uphill, dodging tress and bushes, until he reached the crest. Downhill,
  on a field of mud, a tragedy was in motion. Twelve slaves, burly women and
  men, armed in bronze, spears and shields, were taking on twelve hunters: 
  four young girls, four young boys, two women and two men. On the soft ground, a
  hunter not younger than twelve, laid with a bleeding wound.
