    Sol loaded his sling, stood up from the cover of the bushes and swung his weapon. 
    Once, twice, thrice, and then let the missile loose. The stone flew whistling through the air, striking one of the slavers right in the
    back of her helmet. 
    The slaver tottered and almost fell but quickly recovered her posture.
    Sol reached for his weapong again, but his second hasted stone hit the shield of his target harmlessly.
      There wouldn't be time for a third try, for the slavers, hardened warriors, reacted swiftly sending a
    four of their numbers charging uphill. 
      One burly woman, the one he had hit, and three grown men against the young kid.
      Sol dropping all but his weapons ran away dodging trees, jupming over bushes as he went, branches 
    scratching his skin. 
      The boy kept his pace after losing sight of his pursuers and even sped up as he emerged from the knoll.
      Yet a rushing of sandals rushed after him. Nothing else was heard; every bit of will of the brave warriors were
    put to their feet. 
      The race stood on, longer than a wise heart can bear, with no advantage gained or lost. 
      But suddenly Sol felt his breath scrapping his throat and stopped to turn around and stand his ground, his spear ready.

     The slavers slowed down their approach and spread their front before approaching their victim from three sides.
   Sol answered by thrusting his spear, high and low, dancing as he went, keeping his enemies away. Greener men would
     have rushed to the boy's bronze tip, paying the price in blood, but these feinted and kept the boy guessing their
     movements. Sol didn't see her, Sol couldn't, Sol had no trace of her but an odd sense of danger until she jumped
     on the boys back, smashing him against the dust of the prairy. At once the other three warriors raced to the boy.
     And it was all over.
    <p>
      
    <p>
      The four slavers stood up with their prize. Sol did not struggle as four strong arms pulled him off the ground,
     barefoot and almost naked. It would be pointless now, with his hands strongly bound after his back, his strength
     lost. He did not even offer a sight of defiance but neither of fear, summision or despair. For their part the slavers
      were happy to have got him, painting their names on his back with ochre.
  </p>

    By the time they reached their comrades, the hunters too had fell and were either under the yoke or upon the dust,
    a feast for the carrions. Sol was too leashed to the line of the slaves and together with the rest marched northwards,
    where the Great City lay, not eastwards.
