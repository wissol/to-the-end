<p>
  Yoked and leashed, the captives were marched in a long line. Ten <em>rek</em>, a short
  rest for a bowl of lukewarm <em>gud</em>, then another ten. As for the measure
  of <em>rek</em>, that was made by the chief slaver by the simple means of placing
  the butt of her spear on the ground and point the tip to a hill, one of the suns
  at its midday or any other known reference. Not an easy job, and neither precisely
  precise, so more often than not the day was ended whenever the slavers felt 
  the need to sit down.
</p>

<p>
  By that time the captives were fully exhausted. Sun, as much as the others, had
  to bear the yoke as it sanded his neck and the stung of a thousands <em>mezzezz</em>
  midges. For the younger children and the injured, it was much worse. Though, 
  nobody fell the first day, and as the first twilight came, so came respite.
</p>

<p>
  The slavers bundled the captives in groups of six, chaining them hand to feet,
  and feet to hand, and then allowed them to lay on the ground. Nothing to cover
  them, but the night was warm and the fire close enough.
</p>

<p>
  The youngest among the slavers, a girl not much older than Sun and by no means
  a warrior, came to his group to give a kind of speech in the language of traders,
  which, &mdash;translated literally&mdash; is:
</p>

<p>
  "Now you listen. We command. You pee, we allow. You poop, we punish with burning
  coals. You speak low, we allow. You speak loud, we punish with burning coals. 
  You run, we punish with bronze blade. We make a cut in toes yours and poop on it.
  You ask questions us, we spit on your eyes. You put eyes on us, we take one eye yours.
  Now you rest. We command."
</p>

<p>
  As the first sun disappeared under the horizon and only the soft light of <em>Yer</em>
  remained, so ended the sounds of the day. The captives found themselves dropping
  to nightmares by the sheer weight of his exhaustion and so too was about to close
  his eyes, when Arla, a girl of 12 to which he was linked addressed him in his
  own tongue, words that  &mdash;translated literally&mdash; were:
</p>

<p>"See me, do you?"</p>
<p>"I Explore a smile, yours. But day is sadness."</p>
<p>"Day is sadness, but now is night."</p>

<p>And then they both slipped away to dream-age which the Goddess who was and will be,
  but is not... yet, rules.
